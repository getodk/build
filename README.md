# ODK Build

[![docker](https://github.com/getodk/build/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/getodk/build/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

ODK Build is a web-based, drag-and-drop service for creating forms used with data collection tools such as [ODK Collect](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-intro/) and [ODK Central](https://docs.getodk.org/central-intro/). 
ODK Build is part of ODK, a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. Learn more about the ODK project and its history [here](https://getodk.org/) and read about example ODK deployments [here](https://forum.getodk.org/c/showcase).

## Get started

If you want to build forms while offline, Build offers an [offline version](docs/offline.md).
